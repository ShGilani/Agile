Welcoming Changing Requirements:
- What happens if you have a jar that's full of sand and you've been given some river rocks you need to add to the jar? Will they fit? What will you do? For many projects using traditional methodologies, there was always a full list of requirements to be delivered, a full jar. Additional requests were known as scope creep. How do we address Agile's second principle, welcome changing requirements?

 The answer is very simple. It's to prioritize your backlog. Agile relies on the principle of customer value prioritization. Sounds fancy, but really all it means is that what the customers value the most are the highest priority. So, as your requirements change, the product owner works with the stakeholders to organize the backlog continuously with the highest value items at the top of the list. In this way, as new requirements come in, less valuable items are pushed to the bottom of the backlog. Remember the jar I mentioned earlier? Well the analogy is that the highest value items go into the jar first, the river rocks, and the less valuable items, the sand, can fit in when and if they can.
 
 Agile Prioritization:
  Some of the most common techniques are Kano and MoSCoW. Let's take a look at these. 
  
  Kano is really a categorization tool that's used to help establish priorities.
   If your PO chooses to use this technique, she will assess all of your customer requirements or stories with the stakeholders in a meeting, and they'll categorize them into one of these four types. 
   First is exciters, also known as delighters, are features that deliver new, very valuable functionality.
   Satisfiers, or basic features, are ones that the customers expect. They don't get too excited about them. They just expect them to be there.
   Dissatisfiers are things that will cause your customer to dislike the product if they're not there.
   indifferent features are the ones that customers don't care about at all, and so will have little impact on their happiness with your product. These are features that would have a low priority.
   
  While Kano is an effective technique for prioritzing your stories, you may run into issues when you have a large group of stakeholders. Their individual preferences will make coming to agreement more challenging.
   
   
    Similar to Kano is a prioritization model known as MoSCoW. 
    That's an acronym for its categories: must have, should have, could have, and would like to have but not now.
    
     In traditional project management, they may have had months in between touch points and now it will be days or weeks.
      As you move through your project, be sure to acknowledge and thank your stakeholders for their ongoing input and involvement. Remember, in agile, we recognize that projects are done by people, for people. Successful, ongoing engagement and collaboration with your stakeholders will help you drive your project home.
     There's a direct correlation between involvement and engagement. 
     
     On Agile teams, we focus on making decisions quickly with no second guessing. With Agile projects, the goal is participatory decision making. That means everyone gets to chime in with their ideas, preferences, and votes.
     
     . There are many techniques you can use to drive your stakeholders towards convergence. That's just a fancy word for collective agreement.
     
      First, there's the ever present one person, one vote technique.
