Understand 'why' of Agile before we dive into the how.

value-driven delivery | Agile Mindset | 

Planning is a daily practice in Agile methodologies. 

 Traditional project management was based on the repeatability, what we call defined processes.
 
 Industrial revolution ---> Information Revolution
 Repeatability / More Predictability    --------> Less Predictability
 
 - If you work in a factory or on an assembly line, your daily activities have very little variance. You can come in and repeat the same steps over and over with almost no difference in the result that you get. Most people worked in this kind of environment until the late 20th century. That's when the industrial revolution shifted to the knowledge or information revolution. When we shifted gears, the predictability of our work also changed. 
 
 Empirical process: Learn and Adapt as you go
Beginning in the 1980s and '90s, knowledge workers began to see that they work in a completely different environment, one that's unpredictable. You have to learn and adapt as you go. We call this the empirical process.
