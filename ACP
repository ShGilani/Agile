Only by understanding the roots and philosophy behind Agile can you be completely successful. 
Understand 'why' of Agile before we dive into the how.

value-driven delivery | Agile Mindset | 

Planning is a daily practice in Agile methodologies. 

 Traditional project management was based on the repeatability, what we call defined processes.
 
 Industrial revolution ---> Information Revolution
 Repeatability / More Predictability    --------> Less Predictability
 
 - If you work in a factory or on an assembly line, your daily activities have very little variance. You can come in and repeat the same steps over and over with almost no difference in the result that you get. Most people worked in this kind of environment until the late 20th century. That's when the industrial revolution shifted to the knowledge or information revolution. When we shifted gears, the predictability of our work also changed. 
 
 Empirical process: Learn and Adapt as you go
Beginning in the 1980s and '90s, knowledge workers began to see that they work in a completely different environment, one that's unpredictable. You have to learn and adapt as you go. We call this the empirical process.

This fundamental change required a shift in mindset. Anyone can do Agile practices, but the full benefit of them can't be realized unless we adopt the Agile mindset. 

 - "We expect uncertainty and manage for it "through iterations, anticipation, and adaptation. 
 - "We deliver reliable results by engaging customers "in frequent interactions and shared ownership. 
 - "We unleash creativity and innovation by recognizing "that individuals are the ultimate source of value, "and creating an environment "where they can make a difference. 
 
  To sum these up, thinking Agile or having an Agile mindset means that you welcome change, you focus on short, value-driven delivery cycles, you learn through discovery,
  you continuous deliver so you can obtain feedback and improve your product and processes. 

 Anyone can do Agile practices, but it's not enough unless you, as a leader, are demonstrating what it means to be Agile.
