5 whys is an Iterative Interrogative Technique.

The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. 

The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?". Each answer forms the basis of the next question.

The questioning for this example could be taken further to a sixth, seventh, or higher level, but five iterations of asking why is generally sufficient to get to a root cause.
The key is to encourage the trouble-shooter to avoid assumptions and logic traps and instead trace the chain of causality.

the real root cause should point toward a process that is not working well or does not exist.

Untrained facilitators will often observe that answers seem to point towards classical answers such as not enough time, not enough investments, or not enough manpower.
These answers may be true, but they are out of our control. Therefore, instead of asking the question why?, ask why did the process fail?
