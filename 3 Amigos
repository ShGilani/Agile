3 Amigos refers to the 3 primary perspectives need to examine an increment of work before, during, and after development.  

Those perspectives are:

Business – What problem are we trying to solve?
Development – How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
Testing – How can we ensure the solution's quality?

People holding these different perspectives should collaborate (have regular meetings) to define what to do, and agree on how they know when it is done correctly.  
The end result of such a collaboration results in a clearer description of an increment of work often in the form of examples, leading to a shared understanding for the team.

The concept of three amigos intends to balance between no collaboration between people with different perspectives and involving an entire team in discussing all the details of every increment of work.
