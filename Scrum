Scrum is a framework (Supporting/Guiding Structure) not a methodology (Step by Step way of doing thing). 
It is an additive framework that allows extension, provided the defined elements are met.

There are 3 defined roles, 3 defined artefacts, and 5 events in Scrum. They are supported by some implied elements.

3 together becomes the Scrum Team:
Scrum Master
Development Team
Product Owner

Product Backlog
Sprint Backlog
Product Increment

Sprint
Sprint Planning
Daily Scrum
Sprint Review
Sprint Retrospective

Implied Events and Artefacts:
Backlog Grooming/Product Backlog Refinement
Sprint Goal
Definition of “Done”.


Scrum works in 'Complex Domain'. (Not Simple/Complicated)
It adds most value when there is an element of uncertainty in the requirements and technology, implementation.


A best practice is a practice you use everywhere all the time as the best way to do your work.
The type of work that Scrum teams do is typically 'complex' for any particular practice to always be the best approach, so there’s no such thing as a best practice in Scrum.
We’ve seen many organizations take the idea of “best” practices too far (like with the 500-page manual) that detailed the processes and “best” practices that all their Scrum teams had to follow, which is wrong. We aren’t against teams creating their own practices within the Scrum framework—that’s actually a good sign of a team that’s working well together. 

Key Concepts:
Empiricism
Transparency
Regular/Frequent Inspection & Feedbacks
pull mechanism
Self-organizing Team

intrinsic motivation is achieved through maximising autonomy, mastery and purpose.

Scrum is a very simple framework that's entirely focused on doing just enough preparation, just in time for development work to begin. The founders of Scrum understood that doing too much preparation too far in advance of the work resulted in poor design and a lot of rework, as teams learned more and had to change directions. Because of this insight, they proposed that the detail designs only happen close to when the work is slated to be done. They were interested in postponing all the decisions they could in favor of discovering details within the process of development itself. This maximized the efficiency of the developer.
