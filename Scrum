Scrum is a framework (Supporting/Guiding Structure) not a methodology (Step by Step way of doing thing).

Scrum works in 'Complex Domain'. (Not Simple/Complicated)


A best practice is a practice you use everywhere all the time as the best way to do your work.
The type of work that Scrum teams do is typically 'complex' for any particular practice to always be the best approach, so there’s no such thing as a best practice in Scrum.
We’ve seen many organizations take the idea of “best” practices too far (like with the 500-page manual) that detailed the processes and “best” practices that all their Scrum teams had to follow, which is wrong. We aren’t against teams creating their own practices within the Scrum framework—that’s actually a good sign of a team that’s working well together.
