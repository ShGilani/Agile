A playful approach to estimation, used by many Agile teams.

Format of the game:
----------------------
The Product Owner/Scrum Master briefly states the intent and value of a story, What needs to be done to achieve this. 

 Each member of the development team silently picks an estimate for the Story points. 2-5 mins are given to think.
 When everyone has taken their pick, the estimates are read aloud. (physical cards/ online points can be used)

The two (or more) team members who gave the high and low estimate justify their reasoning. 

After brief discussion, the team may seek convergence toward a consensus estimate by playing one or more further rounds or by further discussions. vote-discuss-revote cycle.


One common pitfall of Planning Poker resides in making "convergence to consensus estimate" an obligation rather than a natural result of the conversation that follows a round of play.

Another way to estimate, which is particularly effective when there are a significant number of stories to estimate is to use Affinity Estimation. 
This is where the team tries to quickly group many stories into buckets all at once, rather than focusing on each story at a time.
